1. values added:  20
2. final result:  20
3. values added:  20

4. At line 13, the code returns the error message "ReferenceError: result is not defined". This is because at line 5, the `result` variable is declared as `var` keyword inside the `if` block, meaning that it is only accessible within that block. Thus, trying to access `result` outside of the if block, in the `console.log` statement coming after the `else` statement, would result in a ReferenceError saying that `result` is not defined. In this case, the argument `add` is true, the `if `block will execute, and `result` will be defined and printed out in the first `console.log` statement (at line 9). But, the second `console.log` statement (at line 13) that comes after the if-else block would throw an error, as explained above.

5. The code will return the error message "TypeError: Assignment to constant variable" for the line "result = num1 + num2;". This is caused by trying to reassign a new value to a variable `result` that was declared using the `const` keyword. Once a variable is declared using `const`, it cannot be reassigned to a new value. So in the first `console.log` statement at line 9, it will output a type error.

6. The code will return the error message "TypeError: Assignment to constant variable" for the line "result = num1 + num2;". This is caused by trying to reassign a new value to a variable `result` that was declared using the `const` keyword. Once a variable is declared using `const`, it cannot be reassigned to a new value. So in the second `console.log` statement at line 13, it will still output a type error.
